Objective: Migrate logs from Oracle to AWS S3 for long-term storage, enable querying via AWS Athena, and update migration status in Oracle.

Key Steps:

Extract Logs: Retrieve logs from Oracle (e.g., older than 30 days).
Transform Data: Convert logs to Parquet/ORC format for efficient querying.
Load to S3: Store transformed logs in S3 with a structured format (e.g., partitioned by year/month/day).
Query with Athena: Set up an Athena table pointing to S3 for direct querying of logs.
Update Oracle: After migration, update the migration_status column in Oracle to reflect the migration status.








ALTER TABLE i_general_info
ADD COLUMN migration_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING';

Summary (Assumption)	Alternatives Not Taken
AWS S3 as the primary storage solution	Using alternative storage options like Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or on-premises solutions.
Lifecycle policies will manage data archiving	Manually monitoring and transferring data to Glacier or other storage tiers.
Data will be transferred securely using HTTPS	Using less secure transfer methods like unencrypted FTP or non-SSL endpoints.
Logs will be stored in Parquet format	Using alternative formats like JSON, CSV, or Avro, which may result in larger storage requirements.
AWS Athena will be used for querying logs	Using third-party querying tools or custom ETL pipelines for log analysis.
IAM roles provide secure access	Relying on static access keys, which are more prone to security vulnerabilities.
Encryption (at-rest and in-transit) will be used	Keeping logs unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data.
AWS CloudWatch monitors migration	Using third-party monitoring tools or no monitoring, which could lead to undetected issues.
All logs are non-critical during testing	Testing with live critical data, which increases the risk of data loss or corruption.
Versioning is enabled for S3 buckets	Disabling versioning, which makes recovery from accidental deletions more difficult.






Summary	Recommended Testing	Impact
Data Loss	Simulate network failures or migration interruptions to test data integrity and retries.	Loss of critical logs leading to gaps in audit trails or compliance breaches.
Unauthorized Access	Conduct penetration testing and validate IAM roles and policies for proper access controls.	Breach of sensitive data resulting in compliance violations and reputational damage.
Data Corruption	Use checksum validation tests during transfer and compare source and destination data.	Inaccurate logs could lead to incorrect analyses or regulatory non-compliance.
Compliance Violations	Verify adherence to regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) through audits and compliance testing frameworks.	Fines or legal actions from non-compliance with data protection laws.
Cost Overruns	Perform cost simulations using varying data volumes and AWS pricing calculators.	Increased operational costs leading to budget overruns.
Latency in Querying	Test Athena query performance on sample datasets to ensure acceptable response times.	Delayed log retrieval impacting monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting.
Migration Failure	Perform end-to-end migration tests with rollback mechanisms and monitor for errors during test runs.	Loss of trust in the process and potential downtime during re-migration efforts.
Accidental Deletion	Simulate lifecycle rules and deletion scenarios to validate recovery options (e.g., versioning).	Permanent loss of critical data if recovery fails.
Access Performance Issues	Run load testing on Athena queries and S3 access patterns with production-scale datasets.	Poor performance causing delays in analytics and operational decisions.
Security Misconfigurations	Use automated security scanners (e.g., AWS Config, S3 Bucket Audit tools) to identify misconfigurations.	Public exposure of logs leading to data breaches and reputational harm.







Risk	Summary	Mitigation	Likelihood	Impact
Data Loss	Logs could be lost during migration due to network failures or process errors.	Implement retries, validate data integrity with checksums, and maintain backups during migration.	Medium	High
Unauthorized Access	Logs may contain sensitive data and could be accessed by unauthorized parties.	Enable encryption (at-rest and in-transit), use IAM roles, and enforce strict access controls.	Low	High
Data Corruption	Log files could become corrupted during transfer or storage.	Validate data integrity using checksums and regularly audit S3 data.	Low	Medium
Compliance Violations	Logs may not meet data retention, encryption, or privacy compliance requirements in AWS.	Ensure compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR) and use appropriate S3 storage classes.	Low	High
Cost Overruns	Storing large volumes of data in AWS S3 can lead to unexpectedly high costs.	Monitor storage costs, use lifecycle policies, and enable S3 storage analytics.	Medium	Medium
Latency in Querying	Delayed retrieval of logs due to improper structuring or storage in less accessible classes (e.g., Glacier).	Optimize data structure (e.g., Parquet), use S3 Standard-IA for frequently accessed data, and configure Athena queries.	Medium	Medium
Migration Failure	Migration process might fail midway due to system or script issues.	Use robust ETL tools, monitor the migration process, and test thoroughly before implementation.	Medium	High
Accidental Deletion	Logs may be accidentally deleted or lifecycle rules may remove logs prematurely.	Enable versioning and MFA Delete on S3 buckets.	Low	High
Access Performance Issues	Poor performance due to incorrect partitioning or grouping of logs.	Partition data logically (e.g., by date) and optimize for AWS Athena querying.	Medium	Medium
Security Misconfigurations	Misconfigured S3 bucket policies could lead to public exposure of logs.	Regularly review bucket policies and enable S3 Block Public Access settings.	Low	High



















3. Delete Migrated Records from Oracle
Once records are successfully uploaded to S3, you can delete the migrated records from the Oracle table. The query to delete records with migration_status = 'MIGRATED' is:

sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM log_records
WHERE migration_status = 'MIGRATED'
AND igi_log_time < SYSDATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY;
This query deletes records that have been marked as 'MIGRATED' and are older than 30 days.
Full Process Using Oracle Queries
Fetch Records Older Than 30 Days (in your Java code):

Fetch records using the above query.
Upload records to S3.
Update Migration Status After Upload (in your Java code):

Once the records are uploaded to S3, execute the following SQL in your application to mark the records as 'MIGRATED':
java
Copy
Edit




To implement a Spring Boot application that pulls records from an Oracle database (older than 30 days) and dumps them to AWS S3 with different storage layers (Standard, Standard-IA, and Glacier), we will break down the solution into several key steps. Here's a general approach:

1. Prerequisites
Spring Boot Setup: You need a Spring Boot application.
AWS SDK: You will use the AWS SDK to interact with S3 and set up the storage class logic (Standard, Standard-IA, and Glacier).
JPA / JDBC: Use JPA or JDBC to query Oracle for the records older than 30 days.
S3 Bucket Configuration: Ensure that your S3 bucket has different storage classes configured for the Standard, Standard-IA, and Glacier storage options.
2. Add Dependencies to pom.xml
Here are the required dependencies for Spring Boot, AWS SDK, and Oracle JDBC:

        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-schedule</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
3. Configure Application Properties (application.properties)
Add your Oracle database connection details and AWS S3 credentials.

properties
Copy
Edit
# Oracle Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@your-oracle-db-url
spring.datasource.username=your-username
spring.datasource.password=your-password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# AWS S3 Configuration
aws.access.key.id=your-access-key-id
aws.secret.access.key=your-secret-access-key
aws.region=us-west-2
s3.bucket.name=your-s3-bucket-name
4. Create Oracle Entity
Create an entity class for the records you want to transfer from Oracle.

java
Copy
Edit
@Entity
public class LogRecord {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String logId;
    private String logData;
    private LocalDateTime igiLogTime;  // Time column for filtering

    // Getters and setters...
}
5. Create a Repository to Query Oracle
Create a Spring Data JPA repository to fetch records older than 30 days.

java
Copy
Edit
public interface LogRecordRepository extends JpaRepository<LogRecord, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT l FROM LogRecord l WHERE l.igiLogTime < :date")
    List<LogRecord> findRecordsOlderThan(@Param("date") LocalDateTime date);
}
6. Service to Handle AWS S3 Interactions
This service will handle the logic to upload files to S3 with different storage classes based on the igiLogTime.

java
Copy
Edit
@Service
public class S3Service {

    private final S3Client s3Client;
    private final String bucketName;

    @Autowired
    public S3Service(S3Client s3Client, @Value("${s3.bucket.name}") String bucketName) {
        this.s3Client = s3Client;
        this.bucketName = bucketName;
    }

    public void uploadToS3(String key, String content, StorageClass storageClass) {
        PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = PutObjectRequest.builder()
                .bucket(bucketName)
                .key(key)
                .storageClass(storageClass)
                .build();

        s3Client.putObject(putObjectRequest, RequestBody.fromString(content));
    }

    public void uploadLogToS3(LogRecord log) {
        String content = log.toString(); // Create a string representation of the log record
        LocalDateTime logTime = log.getIgiLogTime();

        // Determine the appropriate storage class
        StorageClass storageClass = getStorageClass(logTime);

        // Generate S3 object key (e.g., based on log ID and date)
        String key = "logs/" + log.getLogId() + "-" + logTime.toLocalDate().toString() + ".txt";

        uploadToS3(key, content, storageClass);
    }

    private StorageClass getStorageClass(LocalDateTime logTime) {
        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
        long daysDifference = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(logTime, now);

        if (daysDifference <= 30) {
            return StorageClass.STANDARD;
        } else if (daysDifference <= 365) {
            return StorageClass.STANDARD_IA;
        } else {
            return StorageClass.GLACIER;
        }
    }
}
7. Scheduler to Trigger Data Transfer
Use Spring’s @Scheduled annotation to periodically pull records older than 30 days and upload them to S3.

java
Copy
Edit
@Service
public class LogTransferService {

    private final LogRecordRepository logRecordRepository;
    private final S3Service s3Service;

    @Autowired
    public LogTransferService(LogRecordRepository logRecordRepository, S3Service s3Service) {
        this.logRecordRepository = logRecordRepository;
        this.s3Service = s3Service;
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 1 * * ?")  // Runs once per day at 1 AM
    public void transferOldLogs() {
        LocalDateTime thirtyDaysAgo = LocalDateTime.now().minusDays(30);
        List<LogRecord> logs = logRecordRepository.findRecordsOlderThan(thirtyDaysAgo);

        for (LogRecord log : logs) {
            s3Service.uploadLogToS3(log);
        }
    }
}
8. Configure AWS S3 Client
Create a configuration class to set up the AWS S3 client using the AWS SDK.

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
public class AwsS3Config {

    @Bean
    public S3Client s3Client() {
        return S3Client.builder()
                .region(Region.of("us-west-2"))
                .credentialsProvider(ProfileCredentialsProvider.create()) // Optional: Can use environment variables or IAM roles
                .build();
    }
}
9. Run the Application
When the application runs, it will pull records older than 30 days from Oracle based on the igiLogTime and upload them to the appropriate S3 storage class (Standard, Standard-IA, or Glacier) based on the age of the logs.
10. Considerations and Improvements
Error Handling: Implement error handling for the file upload process (e.g., failed uploads, retries).
Batch Processing: If the number of records is large, consider processing in batches to avoid memory overload.
Logging: Add appropriate logging to track the process of pulling records and uploading to S3.
File Format: You may want to store the data in a more structured format (e.g., JSON, Parquet) instead of a plain text file, which will depend on your use case.
Summary
Oracle Query: Query records older than 30 days using JPA.
AWS S3: Use AWS SDK to upload data to S3 with different storage classes based on the record age.
Scheduled Task: Use Spring Boot’s @Scheduled annotation to automate the process of transferring data daily.
Multiple Storage Layers: Choose the appropriate S3 storage class (Standard, Standard-IA, Glacier) based on the record’s age.
This solution will allow you to transfer Oracle records to AWS S3 and store them in different layers based on their age efficiently.

-------------------------------
If you are only using Amazon S3 and Athena, and your files are stored in Parquet format, you can set up Athena to query the Parquet data directly from S3. Here are the steps to connect Athena to your S3 bucket and query the Parquet files:

Step 1: Ensure S3 Bucket is Accessible
Ensure that your S3 bucket is configured correctly and is accessible. Athena will need permission to read the files from the S3 bucket. Also, the query results will be saved in an S3 location, so make sure you have a bucket designated for query results.

Step 2: Set Athena Query Result Location
Go to the Athena Console.
In the Settings tab, specify the S3 bucket where Athena will save query results. For example, you can create a bucket s3://your-bucket-name/query-results/ and specify this location in the Athena settings.
Step 3: Create Athena Table for Parquet Data
To query Parquet files, you need to create an Athena table that points to the S3 location of the data. Athena uses the schema of the Parquet files to automatically infer the columns.

Define the Athena table by creating an EXTERNAL table that points to the S3 bucket where your Parquet files are stored.
Example query:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs (
    log_id STRING,
    log_data STRING,
    timestamp STRING,
    other_columns ... -- Define other columns as needed
)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket-name/logs/';  -- Path to your Parquet files in S3
Replace your-bucket-name with your actual S3 bucket name. If your data is partitioned by date (e.g., year, month, day), ensure the partitioning scheme matches the folder structure.

Step 4: Query Data from S3
Once the table is created, you can run queries to access your Parquet data.

Query for specific data:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE log_id = '12345';  -- Example filter for a specific log_id
Query based on a date partition:
If your files are partitioned in S3, for example, by year, month, and day, your S3 structure might look like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
s3://your-bucket-name/logs/year=2025/month=01/day=20/
In this case, your table creation script will need to account for partitions:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logs (
    log_id STRING,
    log_data STRING,
    timestamp STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (year STRING, month STRING, day STRING)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket-name/logs/';
Then, load the partitions into Athena:

sql
Copy
Edit
MSCK REPAIR TABLE logs;
After loading partitions, you can query by specifying the partition fields:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE year = '2025'
  AND month = '01'
  AND day = '20';
Step 5: Query Results and Athena Query History
Athena will store the results of your queries in the S3 bucket you specified earlier. After running the query, you can access the result file in the S3 bucket.
Athena query history can be viewed directly in the Athena console for tracking previous queries.
Summary of Steps:
Create Table in Athena: Define an EXTERNAL table pointing to your Parquet files stored in S3.
Partitioning: If your S3 data is partitioned (e.g., by date), set up partitions in Athena.
Query: Use SQL queries in Athena to retrieve and process the data.
Results: Store query results in an S3 bucket you define in the Athena console.
By following these steps, you'll be able to efficiently query your Parquet data stored in S3 using Athena without the need for additional services like AWS Glue.

ensure s3 bucket is accessible 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure that your S3 bucket is accessible by Amazon Athena, you need to verify a few configurations related to IAM permissions, bucket policies, and correct setup. Here’s a checklist to ensure the S3 bucket is accessible for Athena:

1. Bucket Permissions (IAM Role/Policy)
Your IAM user or role that Athena uses must have the appropriate permissions to read from the S3 bucket. The permissions required are:

s3:GetObject: Allows Athena to read the objects (files) in the S3 bucket.
s3:ListBucket: Allows Athena to list the objects in the bucket.
s3:PutObject (if you need Athena to write results to the bucket): This permission is necessary if Athena needs to write query results to the S3 bucket.
2. IAM Policy for Athena Access
Create an IAM policy for your IAM user or role that allows Athena to read and list files from the S3 bucket. You can use the following policy template:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "athena:StartQueryExecution",
        "athena:GetQueryExecution",
        "athena:GetQueryResults"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Replace your-bucket-name with the actual S3 bucket name.

3. S3 Bucket Policy
Ensure your S3 bucket's policy allows the IAM role or user to access it. Below is an example S3 bucket policy that grants permissions to read from and list the objects in the bucket:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:role/athena-role"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Replace arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:role/athena-role with the correct IAM role ARN used by Athena.

4. Verify Athena Query Results Location
Make sure the query result location in Athena is properly configured to use an S3 bucket. You can check and set the query result location in the Athena console:
Go to the Athena Console.
Click on Settings.
Ensure the Query result location is set to an S3 bucket (e.g., s3://your-query-results-bucket/).
5. Check Bucket Encryption (If Applicable)
If the S3 bucket is using encryption (e.g., SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS), make sure that the IAM role or user has permissions to decrypt the data.

For SSE-S3: No additional permissions are required.
For SSE-KMS: The IAM role or user will need the kms:Decrypt permission to decrypt the objects stored in the bucket.
For example, for SSE-KMS, the policy should include:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id"
}
Replace the key-id with the actual KMS key ID used for encryption.

6. Test Access to S3 from Athena
After setting the permissions, run a simple query in Athena to test the access to the S3 bucket. You can try querying the data from the S3 bucket if your table is already created in Athena or create a new simple table and query it:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM logs
LIMIT 10;
If the permissions are set correctly, this query should return results.

7. Check S3 Bucket Access Logging (Optional)
If you're having trouble with access, enabling S3 bucket logging can help troubleshoot by recording detailed access logs for your bucket. These logs will help you understand if Athena is successfully accessing the files or encountering issues.

Final Checklist:
IAM Role/Policy: Ensure the IAM user/role has s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket permissions for the S3 bucket.
S3 Bucket Policy: Ensure the S3 bucket policy allows the IAM role/user to access the bucket.
Athena Query Results Location: Ensure Athena is set to write results to an S3 bucket.
Encryption (if applicable): Verify IAM role permissions for KMS decryption if using SSE-KMS encryption.
Test Query: Run a simple query in Athena to confirm access.
By following these steps, you'll ensure that Athena can access your S3 bucket and query the data stored in it.












-------------------------------------------------------------
Query for a Date Range and Reference Number:
If you're looking for logs over a specific date range, you can use a range condition like this:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE year = '2025' 
  AND month = '01' 
  AND day BETWEEN '15' AND '20'
  AND IGI_LOG_REFERENCE_NUMBER = 'your_reference_number';

If you have Parquet files stored in S3, you can easily query them using AWS Athena. Parquet is a columnar storage format that allows for more efficient querying, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here's how you can set up Athena to query your Parquet files based on the columns you have and use the date and IGI_LOG_REFERENCE for filtering.

1. Athena Table for Parquet Files
Assuming your Parquet files are already stored in S3 in a directory structure based on dates, you can create an Athena table that points to your S3 location and reads the Parquet files.

Here’s how you can create the Athena table for Parquet:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_log_table (
    IGI_LOG_REFERENCE STRING,
    IGI_LOG_TIME STRING,
    IGI_MACHINE_NME STRING,
    IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS STRING,
    IGI_LOG_TEXT STRING,
    IGI_LOG_LEVEL STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (year STRING, month STRING, day STRING)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/log/';
This query does the following:

Defines columns based on your Oracle table structure.
Partitioning is done by year, month, and day to optimize query performance.
Data is stored as Parquet and located in the s3://your-bucket/log/ folder (adjust as per your actual location).
2. Querying Parquet Files Based on Date
To query logs for a specific day, use partitioning in your query to narrow down the files Athena needs to scan. For example, to get logs for January 20th, 2025:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT IGI_LOG_REFERENCE, IGI_LOG_TIME, IGI_MACHINE_NME, IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS, IGI_LOG_TEXT, IGI_LOG_LEVEL
FROM your_log_table
WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01';
Since the table is partitioned by year, month, and day, Athena will only scan the files corresponding to that date, making it efficient.

3. Querying by IGI_LOG_REFERENCE
If you want to filter the logs by IGI_LOG_REFERENCE for the same day:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT IGI_LOG_REFERENCE, IGI_LOG_TIME, IGI_MACHINE_NME, IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS, IGI_LOG_TEXT, IGI_LOG_LEVEL
FROM your_log_table
WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01'
AND IGI_LOG_REFERENCE = 'specific-reference-id';
This query will filter the logs for January 20th, 2025 and for the specific IGI_LOG_REFERENCE.

4. Querying Parquet Files by Time Range (Optional)
If you need to filter logs by a time range, you can filter based on the IGI_LOG_TIME column. For example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT IGI_LOG_REFERENCE, IGI_LOG_TIME, IGI_MACHINE_NME, IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS, IGI_LOG_TEXT, IGI_LOG_LEVEL
FROM your_log_table
WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01'
AND IGI_LOG_TIME >= '2025-01-20T10:00:00' AND IGI_LOG_TIME <= '2025-01-20T12:00:00';
5. Querying Specific Files in the log Folder
If you want to ensure that you are only querying logs from a particular date (based on file path in S3), you can use the $path system column in your query to filter based on the file location in S3:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT IGI_LOG_REFERENCE, IGI_LOG_TIME, IGI_MACHINE_NME, IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS, IGI_LOG_TEXT, IGI_LOG_LEVEL
FROM your_log_table
WHERE "$path" LIKE 's3://your-bucket/log/2025/01/20/%'
AND IGI_LOG_REFERENCE = 'specific-reference-id';
This query ensures that Athena only scans files stored under the January 20th, 2025 path in S3.

6. Optimize Athena Querying with Partitioning and Parquet
Partitioning by Date (year, month, day): This allows Athena to read only the relevant data for the selected day, reducing the amount of data scanned and improving performance.
Columnar format (Parquet): Parquet files are more efficient for querying because Athena can read only the necessary columns instead of scanning the entire file.
Compression: If your Parquet files are compressed, it will further reduce the amount of data read by Athena.
7. Summary of Queries for Parquet Files
Query logs for a specific day:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM your_log_table WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01';
Query logs by IGI_LOG_REFERENCE:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM your_log_table WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01' AND IGI_LOG_REFERENCE = 'specific-reference-id';
Query logs by IGI_LOG_TIME range:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM your_log_table WHERE day = '2025-01-20' AND year = '2025' AND month = '01' AND IGI_LOG_TIME >= '2025-01-20T10:00:00' AND IGI_LOG_TIME <= '2025-01-20T12:00:00';
Query specific files from log folder:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM your_log_table WHERE "$path" LIKE 's3://your-bucket/log/2025/01/20/%' AND IGI_LOG_REFERENCE = 'specific-reference-id';
Final Recommendations:
Use Partitioning: Partitioning by year, month, and day helps Athena optimize queries, especially when querying by date.
Parquet Files: Ensure your logs are in Parquet format for better performance.
Cost Optimization: Athena charges based on the amount of data scanned, so partitioning and using columnar formats (like Parquet) reduces costs.


Automating with AWS Lifecycle Policy
Instead of manually moving files, you can configure S3 Lifecycle Rules:

Transition logs from log to standard-ia after 30 days
Transition logs from standard-ia to glacier after 6 months
(Optional) Delete logs from Glacier after 1-3 years
S3 Lifecycle Policy JSON
Create a lifecycle policy in your-bucket:

----------------------------------------------------------





If you have the IGI_LOG_REFERENCE number available in each row of the Oracle table, it can be used as part of the Parquet file name for better traceability.

Proposed File Naming Convention
The Parquet file name can include:

IGI_LOG_REFERENCE for unique identification.
Optionally, a timestamp or UUID to avoid conflicts in case of multiple files for the same reference.
Example File Name Formats
Basic Format:

php
Copy
Edit
igi_<IGI_LOG_REFERENCE>.parquet
Example:

Copy
Edit
igi_1011691246791.parquet

To efficiently move this data to AWS S3, you should define a partitioning strategy and a storage lifecycle policy to optimize query performance and cost.

1. Partition Key Strategy
You can partition the data in S3 using the following keys:

Primary Partition: IGI_LOG_TIME (Date-based partitioning)
Example: year=2024/month=03/day=25/
Secondary Partition: IGI_MACHINE_NAME (Machine-based partitioning)
Example: machine=ddc2pipa002.test.closebrothers.com/
Tertiary Partition: IGI_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS (Optional)
Example: ip=10.164.33.149/
Final S3 Path Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
s3://your-bucket/logs/year=2024/month=03/day=25/machine=ddc2pipa002.test.closebrothers.com/ip=10.164.33.149/
This structure will make it efficient to query logs based on date and machine details.

2. Storage Lifecycle Strategy
To optimize costs, move logs through different S3 storage classes:

S3 Standard (0-30 days) → Hot logs available for quick access
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) (30-90 days) → Less frequently accessed logs
S3 Glacier (90 days - 1 year) → Archived logs for compliance
S3 Glacier Deep Archive (1-3 years) → Long-term retention
Permanently Delete (after 3 years) → Clean up old logs
Lifecycle Policy Example

      { "Days": 365, "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE" }
    ],
    "Expiration": { "Days": 1095 }

3. Storing in Parquet Format
For efficient querying with AWS Athena, store data in Parquet format instead of CSV or JSON.

Convert logs to Parquet using AWS Glue, Spark, or Pandas.
Store Parquet files in the structured partition paths.
Use AWS Athena to query logs directly.
Next Steps
Extract logs from the database using AWS DMS, Python, or Spark.
Transform logs into Parquet format.
Upload to S3 following the partitioned path.
Enable lifecycle policies for cost optimization.
Use AWS Athena for querying logs efficiently.

3. Explanation
Fetch logs from Oracle for the last 30 days.
Convert data into Parquet format using Apache Parquet.
Partition data by year/month/day (e.g., s3://your-bucket/logs/year=2024/month=01/day=16/logs.parquet).
Upload file to AWS S3 using AWS SDK.
4. AWS Lifecycle Policy
After uploading, apply an S3 Lifecycle Policy:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "ID": "MoveToIA",
    "Prefix": "logs/",
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Transitions": [
      { "Days": 30, "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA" },
      { "Days": 90, "StorageClass": "GLACIER" },
      { "Days": 365, "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE" }
    ],
    "Expiration": { "Days": 1095 }
  }
]
5. Running the Program
Replace database credentials in DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD.
Replace AWS S3 bucket name in BUCKET_NAME.
Run using:
sh
Copy
Edit
mvn clean package
java -jar target/your-app.jar
6. Querying with AWS Athena
After logs are stored in Parquet, create an AWS Glue Table to query via AWS Athena:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE log_data (
    log_reference STRING,
    log_time STRING,
    machine_name STRING,
    ip_address STRING,
    log_text STRING
) 
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT, day INT)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/logs/';
Now, you can query logs using:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM log_data WHERE year=2024 AND month=1 AND day=16;
Final Thoughts
Parquet reduces storage costs and improves Athena query speed.
Partitioning optimizes queries based on log dates.
AWS S3 Lifecycle rules manage storage costs.

To include IGI_LOG_REFERENCE in the file name when saving logs to AWS S3, modify the logic that generates the file name. Since multiple log references exist in a batch, we'll use the first log reference in the batch as part of the file name.

Updated Code
Changes:

Extract the first IGI_LOG_REFERENCE from the batch.
Modify file naming format:
Format: logs/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/igi_<IGI_LOG_REFERENCE>.parquet

IGI log time should be use to partition the s3

To partition the S3 storage based on IGI_LOG_TIME instead of the current date, we need to:

Extract the IGI_LOG_TIME value from each record.
Convert IGI_LOG_TIME (e.g., "25-MAR-24") into YYYY/MM/DD format.
Use this date for partitioning in S3.
Updated Java Code
This version partitions the logs by IGI_LOG_TIME instead of the current system date.

Note over S3: Apply lifecycle policies for cost optimization







The goal is to migrate i-Prompt system logs from an on-premises Oracle database to AWS S3 in a queryable format using AWS Athena. The solution ensures scalability, cost optimization, and adherence to data retention policies. Logs will be stored in S3 with lifecycle management and updated in Oracle to mark them as migrated. Additionally, migrated records will be deleted periodically to free up space in Oracle.




The i-Prompt system generates extensive logs that are stored in an on-premises Oracle database. These logs provide critical insights into system performance, user activities, and error diagnostics. However, as the volume of logs increases over time, maintaining these logs in the Oracle database becomes cost-intensive and impacts system performance.

To address this, there is a need to migrate logs older than 30 days to a cost-effective and scalable storage solution on AWS while ensuring

that the logs remain queryable for analytical and compliance purposes. AWS S3, coupled with Athena, is selected as the target platform due to its efficient storage and query capabilities.

Key Requirements
Data Movement

Move i-Prompt system logs from Oracle to AWS S3.
Logs must be converted into a format (e.g., Parquet) suitable for querying in AWS Athena.
Storage Management

Retain logs in S3 Standard-IA for 3 months for quick access.
Transition logs to S3 Glacier after 3 months for long-term archival.
Implement lifecycle policies to delete logs from Glacier after 1 or 3 years based on compliance requirements.
Oracle Database Updates

After successfully moving a log entry to S3, update the corresponding Oracle table row to mark the log as "migrated" or set a migration timestamp.
Log Deletion from Oracle

Implement a batch process or SQL-based job to periodically delete logs marked as "migrated" from the Oracle database to free up storage space.
Query Capability

Enable query access to the logs stored in S3 using AWS Athena by creating an appropriate schema for Parquet files.
Automation

Automate the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process using a tool or custom scripts (e.g., Python with boto3, AWS Glue).
Ensure the lifecycle management and Oracle updates are also automated.
Error Handling and Monitoring

Implement retry mechanisms and log failures during migration.
Monitor the migration process, storage usage in S3, and query performance in Athena.
Compliance and Security

Secure sensitive log data during migration and storage using encryption.
Control access to S3 buckets, Athena, and Oracle through IAM roles and policies.
