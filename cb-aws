1Ô∏è‚É£ User (On-Premises App) requests a document using the GUID.
2Ô∏è‚É£ API Gateway forwards the request to the appropriate Lambda function.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda function queries DynamoDB for metadata (S3 path).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda function generates a pre-signed URL for secure S3 access.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda function returns the pre-signed URL to the client.
6Ô∏è‚É£ User accesses the document using the pre-signed URL.


Document Upload Flow
User uploads a document from the on-premises application.
The request is routed via AWS Direct Connect to API Gateway.
API Gateway triggers a Lambda function to process the upload.
Lambda performs the following actions:
Generates a unique GUID for tracking.
Uploads the document to an S3 bucket (s3://document-bucket/GUID.pdf).
Stores metadata (GUID, filename, upload time, S3 path) in DynamoDB.
Lambda returns the GUID to the client for future reference.
4. API Endpoint
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/upload	Uploads a document, stores metadata, and returns a GUID.
Request Example
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "filename": "contract.pdf",
  "content": "<base64-encoded-file>"
}
Response Example
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "guid": "abc123-xyz789",
  "message": "Document uploaded successfully."
}
5. Security Measures
‚úÖ IAM Policies restrict API and S3 access.
‚úÖ S3 Encryption ensures document security.
‚úÖ Pre-signed URLs prevent unauthorized access.
‚úÖ CloudWatch Logs monitor API activity.

------------------------
Objective
The goal of this solution is to implement a highly scalable, secure, and efficient document management system that supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The system will leverage AWS cloud services, ensuring reliability, security, and performance while integrating with existing infrastructure via AWS Direct Connect.

Architecture Overview
The solution consists of the following AWS components:

API Gateway: Acts as an entry point, handling API requests from external services.
AWS Lambda: Manages separate functions for each CRUD operation.
Amazon S3: Stores documents securely with access control.
Amazon DynamoDB: Maintains metadata such as document GUID, S3 URL, timestamps, and other attributes.
AWS Direct Connect: Provides a dedicated, low-latency connection between on-premise infrastructure and AWS services.
Key Functionalities
Create Document:

Client uploads a document via API Gateway.
Lambda generates a GUID, stores metadata in DynamoDB, and uploads the document to S3.
GUID is returned to the client for future reference.
Read Document:

Client requests a document using its GUID.
Lambda retrieves metadata from DynamoDB and generates a signed URL from S3.
The signed URL is sent to the client for secure access.
Update Document:

Client sends a request with GUID and a new document.
Lambda updates the document in S3 and updates metadata in DynamoDB.
Delete Document:

Client sends a delete request with GUID.
Lambda removes the document from S3 and metadata from DynamoDB.
Benefits of the Solution
‚úÖ Scalability: Serverless architecture scales automatically.
‚úÖ Security: AWS IAM policies, encryption, and signed URLs ensure data protection.
‚úÖ Performance: Low-latency access via AWS Direct Connect.
‚úÖ Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go model with serverless functions reducing infrastructure costs.
‚úÖ Reliability: Highly available AWS services ensure system uptime.

Next Steps
Develop API contracts and security policies.
Deploy infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
Implement and test Lambda functions.
Optimize performance and monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.
