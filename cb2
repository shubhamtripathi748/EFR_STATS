i Swathi,

As we discussed earlier, you are responsible for creating an Impact Assessment Confluence page to document the detailed impact assessment for transitioning from e-Postcode to Experian CDP.

To assist with this, I have already created the page and added the relevant details, including a comparison matrix, key considerations, and a structured breakdown of the changes required. Additionally, I have included request and response samples at the bottom of the page for reference.


Hi Arvind and Swathi,

As per the suggested template, I have created the design document for our project. I have filled in the details based on my experience, but there are a few sections where I either lack complete information or require further clarification. In such cases, I have marked them as blank or TBD (To Be Determined).

I would appreciate it if you could review the document and provide your inputs. Please let me know if there are any gaps that need to be addressed or any additional details that should be included. Your feedback will help refine and finalize the document.

Looking forward to your suggestions.



This table tracks the migration of images from Oracle to AWS S3, ensuring data consistency and providing status updates.

SELECT COLUMN_ID, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, DATA_LENGTH 
FROM USER_TAB_COLUMNS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME'
ORDER BY COLUMN_ID;

The datastore package consists of two core entities:

IscannedImage → Represents images stored in Oracle (Main Table).
S3ImageStatus → Tracks migration status and S3 URL (New Table).

Steps in Migration Process
Spring Scheduler triggers the batch process (@Scheduled method).
Fetch pending records from i_scanned_image where MIGRATION_STATUS = 'PENDING'.
Loop over each record:
Fetch BLOB data (image).
Call IBM API-C to upload the image to AWS S3.
Receive S3 URL and upload status.
Update the tracking table (s3_image_status).
Update i_scanned_image.MIGRATION_STATUS to 'SUCCESS' or 'FAILED'.
Handle Errors:
If API call fails, update UPLOAD_STATUS = 'FAILED' and log ERROR_MESSAGE.

------------------



To maintain data integrity in your i-scanned-image and s3-image-status tables, you should enforce the following rules:

1. Entity Integrity (Ensuring Uniqueness of Records)
Rule	Enforcement	Implementation
Primary Key Constraint	Ensures each record is uniquely identifiable.	- ISI_BARCODE is the Primary Key in i-scanned-image.
- ID is the Primary Key in s3-image-status.
Unique Constraint on ISI_BARCODE	Prevents duplicate barcode records.	- ISI_BARCODE in i-scanned-image should be UNIQUE.
2. Referential Integrity (Maintaining Relationships Between Tables)
Rule	Enforcement	Implementation
Foreign Key Constraint	Ensures s3-image-status only contains valid ISI_BARCODE values from i-scanned-image.	- ISI_BARCODE in s3-image-status is a FOREIGN KEY referencing i-scanned-image.ISI_BARCODE.
- ON DELETE RESTRICT prevents deleting records from i-scanned-image if they exist in s3-image-status.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a tabular description for each field in the s3-image-status and i-scanned-image tables:

1. s3-image-status Table:
Field Name	Description	Data Type	Additional Information
ID	Unique identifier for each record.	SERIAL (auto-increment)	Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
ISI_BARCODE	Barcode identifier associated with the image from the i-scanned-image table.	VARCHAR(255)	Foreign key to i-scanned-image.ISI_BARCODE.
S3_URL	URL of the uploaded image stored in AWS S3.	VARCHAR(512)	Stores the URL of the image in S3.
UPLOAD_STATUS	Status of the image upload process (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILURE).	VARCHAR(20)	Describes whether the upload was successful or not.
S3_UPLOAD_DATE	Date and time when the image was uploaded to S3.	TIMESTAMP	Timestamp for when the image was uploaded to S3.
ERROR_MESSAGE	Optional error message in case the upload fails or there’s an issue with the process.	TEXT	Stores detailed error information if the upload fails.
PROCESS_STATUS	Status of the image processing (e.g., PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, PROCESSED).	VARCHAR(20)	Indicates the processing stage of the image migration.
2. i-scanned-image Table:
Field Name	Description	Data Type	Additional Information
ISI_BARCODE	Barcode identifier for the scanned image.	VARCHAR(255)	Primary key, unique barcode for each image.
ISI_FILE_TYPE	Type of the file (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).	VARCHAR(50)	Specifies the file type or format of the scanned image.
ISI_FILE_SIZE_KB	Size of the image file in kilobytes (KB).	INT	Stores the size of the file in kilobytes.
ISI_FILE_COMPRESSED	Indicates whether the image is compressed.	BOOLEAN	TRUE if compressed, FALSE if uncompressed.
ISI_DATE_CREATED	Date and time when the image was created or scanned.	TIMESTAMP	Timestamp indicating when the image was created.
ISI_FILE	The actual image file or binary data (if applicable).	BLOB	Stores the binary data of the image (if stored in the database).
MIGRATION_STATUS	Status of the migration process (e.g., PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILURE).	VARCHAR(20)	Tracks the migration status of the image.

Foreign Key Relationship: The ISI_BARCODE in s3-image-status references the ISI_BARCODE in i-scanned-image.
Auto-Incrementing ID: The ID column in s3-image-status is used for unique identification and is auto-incremented.
Image URL: The S3_URL stores the public URL of the image uploaded to AWS S3.
This tabular format clarifies the structure and purpose of each field in both tables.







------------------------------------
Certainly! To clarify and adjust the DDL with ISI_BARCODE as an index in both tables, I'll provide the corrected version:

1. s3-image-status Table:
We'll ensure that ISI_BARCODE is indexed for fast lookups (in addition to the primary key ID).

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE s3_image_status (
    ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,               -- Auto-incrementing ID
    ISI_BARCODE VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    -- Foreign key referencing i-scanned-image
    S3_URL VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,         -- URL of the image stored on AWS S3
    UPLOAD_STATUS VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,   -- Status of the upload ('SUCCESS', 'FAILURE')
    S3_UPLOAD_DATE TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,    -- Timestamp of the upload
    ERROR_MESSAGE TEXT,                  -- Optional error message
    PROCESS_STATUS VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING',  -- Status of the process ('PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'PROCESSED')
    CONSTRAINT fk_isi_barcode FOREIGN KEY (ISI_BARCODE) REFERENCES i_scanned_image (ISI_BARCODE)
);

-- Adding an index on ISI_BARCODE for faster lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_isi_barcode_s3 ON s3_image_status (ISI_BARCODE);
2. i-scanned-image Table:
In the i-scanned-image table, ISI_BARCODE will also be indexed for fast access during migration.

sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE i_scanned_image
ADD COLUMN MIGRATION_STATUS VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING';  -- New column to track migration status

-- Adding an index on ISI_BARCODE for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_isi_barcode_i_scanned_image ON i_scanned_image (ISI_BARCODE);
Explanation of Changes:
s3-image-status Table:
ISI_BARCODE is indexed as idx_isi_barcode_s3 for quick lookups in case you need to find migration status by barcode.
i-scanned-image Table:
ISI_BARCODE is indexed as idx_isi_barcode_i_scanned_image for faster queries related to the migration process (e.g., selecting unprocessed records).
Resulting Schema:
i-scanned-image:

Columns: ISI_BARCODE, ISI_FILE_TYPE, ISI_FILE_SIZE_KB, ISI_FILE_COMPRESSED, ISI_DATE_CREATED, ISI_FILE, MIGRATION_STATUS
Index: idx_isi_barcode_i_scanned_image on ISI_BARCODE
s3-image-status:

Columns: ID, ISI_BARCODE, S3_URL, UPLOAD_STATUS, S3_UPLOAD_DATE, ERROR_MESSAGE, PROCESS_STATUS
Index: idx_isi_barcode_s3 on ISI_BARCODE
This configuration ensures that both tables are optimized for queries related to ISI_BARCODE while still maintaining efficient access to each image's migration status.

Explanation:
i-scanned-image table holds the original image metadata.
s3-image-status tracks the S3 URL and upload status for each image (referenced by ISI_BARCODE).
S3_URL stores the S3 URL where the image is uploaded.
UPLOAD_STATUS tracks whether the upload was successful or failed.
S3_UPLOAD_DATE records the date and time when the image was uploaded to S3.
ERROR_MESSAGE stores any error details in case of failure.
Key Points:
This relationship is one-to-one based on ISI_BARCODE, which serves as the primary key in i-scanned-image and as a foreign key in s3-image-status.
The i-scanned-image table holds the image data, while the s3-image-status table tracks the upload status and the S3 URL.
This ERD provides a structure to track image uploads to S3 and monitor the success or failure of each upload.


------------------------------------
Flowchart Steps:
Start

Process begins.
Fetch Image from Oracle Table

Query Oracle for images from the i-Scanned-Image table.
Image Available?

Yes: Proceed to step 4.
No: End process.
Initiate Image Upload to AWS S3 via IBM API Connect

Send image data to IBM API Connect for processing and uploading to S3.
Branch to success or failure.
Upload Successful?

Yes: Proceed to step 6.
No: Go to failure handling (Step 7).
Update Status in Oracle Table (Success)

Update the upload_status field in the Oracle table to "Success" for the processed image.
Record the S3 URL in the Oracle table.
Branch to success condition (Step 8).
Upload Failed?

Yes: Log failure and update Oracle with failure status.
No: Go to retry logic.
Log Success and Continue Processing

Log success and continue to the next image (Step 2).
Log Failure and Retry

Retry the image upload a defined number of times (e.g., 3 retries).
If retries exceed the limit, mark as failed in Oracle.
End

Key Branching Logic:
Image Available? — If no image is available, end the process.
Upload Successful? — If upload fails, handle error (log, notify, retry) and update the Oracle table with a failure status.
Log Success and Continue Processing — If the upload is successful, log success and continue to process the next image.
Retry Logic — If the upload fails, retry up to a defined limit before marking it as failed in the Oracle table.

i-Scanned-Image Common Processing Flow with Status Updates (Success/Failure)
To effectively process the migration of scanned images from Oracle to AWS S3 and update the status in the Oracle table, you need to follow a common processing flow. This includes handling success and failure scenarios, and updating the Oracle table accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process with handling for both success and failure:

1. Common Processing Flow
Step 1: Extract Image from Oracle
Query Oracle: Fetch the BLOB (image data) from the Oracle database based on a specific condition (e.g., image that needs to be processed or not yet uploaded to S3).
Check for Missing Data: Ensure that the image and its metadata (e.g., image ID) are available for processing.
Step 2: Upload Image to AWS S3
Upload to S3: Use the AWS SDK to upload the image to S3.
Generate a unique URL for the uploaded image.
Handle any potential errors during the upload, such as timeouts or AWS S3 access issues.
Step 3: Update Oracle Table with S3 URL and Status
On Success:
Update the Oracle table with the following information:
S3 URL: The URL of the uploaded image on S3.
Status: The status indicating success (e.g., Uploaded Successfully).
On Failure:
Update the Oracle table with the following information:
Status: The status indicating failure (e.g., Upload Failed or Processing Error).
Optionally, log the error details for debugging or further analysis.
Step 4: Error Handling and Logging
If any step fails (e.g., image extraction, upload to S3, Oracle update), log the error with details, including the image ID, and ensure proper status update in Oracle.
2. Processing Flow with Success and Failure Handling
Success Scenario:
If the image is successfully extracted from Oracle and uploaded to S3:
Extract the image from Oracle.
Upload the image to S3.
Update the Oracle table with the S3 URL and Status as Uploaded Successfully.
java
Copy code
public void migrateImageToS3(Image image) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Extract Image from Oracle (Assuming image is already fetched from Oracle)
        
        // Step 2: Upload Image to AWS S3
        String s3Url = uploadImageToS3(image);
        
        // Step 3: Update Oracle Table with S3 URL and Status
        updateOracleWithStatus(image.getId(), s3Url, "Uploaded Successfully");
        
        System.out.println("Image uploaded successfully: " + image.getId());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Step 4: Failure Scenario
        updateOracleWithStatus(image.getId(), null, "Upload Failed: " + e.getMessage());
        System.out.println("Error uploading image: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
Failure Scenario:
If any step fails (e.g., failure in S3 upload or Oracle update):
Log the failure and ensure proper status update in Oracle.
Update the Oracle table with the Status as Upload Failed and include any relevant error details (e.g., AWS S3 upload error).
java
Copy code
public void migrateImageToS3(Image image) {
    try {
        // Step 1: Extract Image from Oracle (Assuming image is already fetched from Oracle)
        
        // Step 2: Upload Image to AWS S3 (Simulating failure here)
        String s3Url = uploadImageToS3(image);
        
        // Step 3: Update Oracle Table with S3 URL and Status
        updateOracleWithStatus(image.getId(), s3Url, "Uploaded Successfully");
        
        System.out.println("Image uploaded successfully: " + image.getId());
    } catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
        // Step 4: Failure Scenario - AWS Specific Failure (e.g., S3 upload error)
        updateOracleWithStatus(image.getId(), null, "S3 Upload Failed: " + e.getMessage());
        System.out.println("Error during S3 upload: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // General Failure - Any other failure
        updateOracleWithStatus(image.getId(), null, "Processing Error: " + e.getMessage());
        System.out.println("Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
3. Oracle Table Update Logic
You need to update the Oracle table with the S3 URL and status after each migration attempt.

SQL Table Structure Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE scanned_images (
    image_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    image_data BLOB,
    s3_url VARCHAR2(1024),
    upload_status VARCHAR2(50),
    error_message VARCHAR2(4000)
);
Update Logic (on Success or Failure):
java
Copy code
public void updateOracleWithStatus(int imageId, String s3Url, String status) {
    String query = "UPDATE scanned_images SET s3_url = ?, upload_status = ? WHERE image_id = ?";
    
    if (status.contains("Failed")) {
        // If failed, optionally log the error message
        query = "UPDATE scanned_images SET upload_status = ?, error_message = ? WHERE image_id = ?";
    }
    
    try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection(); 
         PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {
        
        if (status.contains("Failed")) {
            stmt.setString(1, status);
            stmt.setString(2, "Error details here"); // Replace with actual error message if needed
        } else {
            stmt.setString(1, s3Url);
            stmt.setString(2, status);
        }
        
        stmt.setInt(3, imageId);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.out.println("Error updating Oracle table: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
4. Possible Status Updates:
Status	Description
Uploaded Successfully	The image was successfully uploaded to S3, and Oracle was updated.
S3 Upload Failed	The image upload to S3 failed due to issues like network failure.
Processing Error	A general error occurred during image extraction or processing.
Upload Failed	A failure occurred during the upload process or S3 interaction.
Oracle Update Failed	The status update in Oracle failed (due to DB connection issues, etc.)
Image Not Found	The image was not found in Oracle for processing.
5. Conclusion:
Success Handling: Upon successful image extraction and upload to S3, the Oracle table is updated with the S3 URL and the status Uploaded Successfully.

Failure Handling: If any error occurs, the Oracle table is updated with the status Upload Failed and optionally the error details. You can also implement retry mechanisms depending on the failure type (e.g., transient AWS errors).



---------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot Scheduler for i-Scanned-Image Migration
Spring Boot provides an easy way to schedule tasks using the @Scheduled annotation. This allows you to automate periodic tasks, such as migrating images from Oracle to AWS S3 and updating the status in the Oracle table.

1. Spring Boot Scheduler Details:
Configuring the Scheduler:
Add the @EnableScheduling annotation in your main Spring Boot application class to enable scheduling:

java
Copy code
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
Create a service class to handle the image migration logic. Use the @Scheduled annotation to define the task.

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class ImageMigrationService {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") // This cron expression schedules the task at 2 AM daily
    public void migrateImages() {
        // Logic to extract images from Oracle
        // Logic to upload images to S3
        // Logic to update Oracle with the S3 URL and status
        System.out.println("Starting image migration from Oracle to S3...");
    }
}
The @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") cron expression schedules the migration to run every day at 2:00 AM. You can adjust the cron expression based on your specific requirements.

Cron Expression Explanation:
0 0 2 * * ? - This cron expression means:
0 Seconds: Start the job at the 0th second.
0 Minutes: Start the job at the 0th minute.
2 Hours: Start the job at 2 AM.
* Day of the month: Every day.
* Month: Every month.
? Day of the week: It doesn’t matter what day of the week.
2. Best Time to Migrate i-Scanned-Image from Oracle to AWS S3:
The best time to perform the migration depends on several factors including system load, network capacity, and usage patterns of the Oracle database and AWS S3.

Factors to Consider:
Low Traffic Period: Perform the migration during off-peak hours when database usage and server load are low. This will minimize the impact on the application and ensure the migration process does not interfere with critical business operations.

Database Load: Choose times when the Oracle database has low query load to reduce the chances of slowing down other database activities.

Network Utilization: Ensure the network bandwidth to AWS S3 is not congested during migration. If possible, schedule the migration when fewer other operations are using the network.

AWS S3 Costs: If there is any consideration of AWS cost, consider the time of day or specific days in the month when network traffic may be lower and the cost is reduced (e.g., nighttime or weekends in some cases).

Recommended Migration Time:
Late Night or Early Morning (12 AM - 4 AM): Typically, organizations experience the lowest load during this period, especially if the target region is expected to have minimal user activity.

Weekends: If your application is less used on weekends, scheduling the migration during these times might ensure smoother operations.

3. Example Migration Scheduler for i-Scanned-Image:
java
Copy code
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class ImageMigrationService {

    // Schedule to run at 2 AM every day
    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?")
    public void migrateImages() {
        // Extract image from Oracle
        // Upload to AWS S3
        // Update Oracle with S3 URL and status
        try {
            System.out.println("Migration process started...");

            // Extract image BLOB from Oracle
            // Upload image to S3
            // Update Oracle with S3 URL and status
            
            System.out.println("Migration process completed successfully.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error during migration: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
Cron Expression Variants:
Every 6 hours: 0 0 0/6 * * ? (every 6 hours).
Every day at midnight: 0 0 0 * * ?.
Every Sunday at 2 AM: 0 0 2 ? * SUN.
4. Additional Considerations:
Error Handling:

Ensure proper error handling to log any migration failures or retries. For example, if the image upload to S3 fails, you should retry the operation or log the error and notify the administrator.
Retry Mechanism:

If an image upload or Oracle update fails, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient failures.
Monitoring:

Use monitoring tools like Spring Boot Actuator, AWS CloudWatch, and Oracle Database logs to track the performance and success of each migration task.
Batch Processing:

If you have a large number of images to migrate, consider migrating in smaller batches (e.g., 100 images at a time) to prevent overwhelming your resources.

Category	Details
Description	i-Prompt is an existing application that will consume the new i-scanned-image migration and CRUD service. It interacts with scanned images for various operations such as retrieval, manipulation, and storage.
System	i-Prompt runs as a Spring Boot microservice and integrates with the new i-scanned-image service via REST APIs. It is deployed in a cloud environment and interacts with AWS S3 and Oracle DB.
Dependencies	- i-scanned-image microservice (new service for image operations)
- AWS S3 (for image storage)
- Oracle Database (metadata storage)
- IAM roles & authentication (API security)
Risks	- Service Downtime: If i-scanned-image is unavailable, i-Prompt cannot access images.
- API Integration Issues: Changes in API contracts may break i-Prompt functionality.
- Performance Bottlenecks: High concurrent image processing may cause delays.
- Data Loss: Migration errors could lead to missing or corrupted images.
Remediation	- Implement API Circuit Breakers (e.g., Resilience4j) to handle service failures gracefully.
- Maintain backward compatibility while integrating APIs.
- Optimize image processing with asynchronous handling and caching.
- Ensure robust logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.
Rollback Steps	- Revert API integration changes in i-Prompt to use the previous data source (Oracle instead of AWS S3).
- Restore images from backup if migration fails.
- Disable i-scanned-image integration in i-Prompt and roll back to an older release.
- Monitor logs and database states to ensure data integrity after rollback.






When using AWS S3 to store i-scanned images, there are several key points to consider to ensure security, efficiency, and scalability. Below are the important key points for leveraging AWS S3 to store i-scanned images effectively:

1. S3 Bucket Configuration
Bucket Naming: Choose a unique, descriptive, and standardized naming convention for your S3 bucket to easily identify it for storing i-scanned images (e.g., company-i-scanned-images).
Region Selection: Select an AWS region that aligns with your data residency requirements, proximity to users, and compliance regulations.
Bucket Policies: Configure bucket policies to control who has access to the data in the bucket. Use least privilege access to limit access to the S3 bucket to authorized users and services only.
Encryption: Enable server-side encryption (SSE) using AWS KMS (Key Management Service) or S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) to ensure that the i-scanned images are stored in an encrypted format.
Public Access: By default, disable public access to your S3 bucket unless absolutely necessary. Use S3 Block Public Access settings to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Data Management
Lifecycle Policies: Implement S3 lifecycle policies to automatically transition images between storage classes (e.g., from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier for archival storage) or delete obsolete images after a certain period.
Versioning: Enable versioning in your S3 bucket to keep multiple versions of i-scanned images. This is especially useful for data recovery in case of accidental deletion or overwrites.
Tags: Use S3 tags to categorize and organize the images. For example, use tags such as Category:Scanned, Type:Document, etc. This makes it easier to search and manage large datasets.
Object Locking: Enable S3 Object Lock if regulatory compliance requires that images cannot be modified or deleted for a specified retention period.
3. Access Control
IAM Roles & Policies: Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles to define who can upload, read, and delete images in your S3 bucket. Assign roles with the least amount of privilege required for tasks.
Pre-signed URLs: For controlled and temporary access to specific images, generate pre-signed URLs that allow access to an image for a limited time without granting permanent permissions.
Access Logging: Enable S3 Access Logs to track requests made to your S3 bucket. These logs provide detailed records of who accessed the images, what actions they took, and from which IP addresses.
Encryption Key Management: Use AWS KMS for managing your encryption keys and to create policies around how these keys can be used (e.g., restrict key access to certain IAM roles or services).
4. Performance Optimization
Multipart Uploads: Use multipart upload to upload large images efficiently. This allows breaking an image into smaller parts and uploading them in parallel, which can significantly improve upload speed.
Transfer Acceleration: Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration to speed up uploads for large i-scanned images, particularly useful when transferring data over long distances or from on-premise environments to AWS.
Caching: Use Amazon CloudFront (CDN) to cache frequently accessed images at edge locations, ensuring faster delivery to end users.
5. Cost Management
Storage Classes: Choose the right storage class for different use cases:
S3 Standard for frequently accessed i-scanned images.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering to optimize costs when the access pattern is unknown or variable.
S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive for archival storage of images that are rarely accessed.
Data Transfer Costs: Minimize unnecessary data transfer by managing how data is accessed, especially when users download images from the S3 bucket. Use CloudFront for efficient content delivery and minimize data transfer fees.
Storage Analytics: Enable S3 Storage Class Analysis to determine when to transition objects to different storage classes based on access patterns.
6. Security and Compliance
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Although IAM policies and bucket policies are preferred, ACLs can be used for fine-grained control over object-level permissions.
Data Integrity: AWS S3 provides MD5 checksum validation for uploads to ensure that the i-scanned images are not corrupted during transmission.
Audit and Monitoring: Use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to monitor and log all actions related to your S3 bucket and objects. This helps in tracking who accessed or modified the i-scanned images.
Compliance Standards: Ensure that your S3 configuration complies with relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by implementing encryption, access controls, and audit logging.
7. Data Backup and Disaster Recovery
Cross-Region Replication (CRR): Set up CRR to automatically replicate images to another S3 bucket in a different region, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.
Cross-AZ Replication: Enable cross-AZ replication to provide resilience in the event of a single Availability Zone failure.
Backup Policies: Ensure that critical images are backed up, either through S3 Backup and Restore or by periodically exporting images to a different storage system for redundancy.
8. Compliance and Data Retention
Compliance with Legal/Regulatory Standards: Ensure that the S3 storage setup complies with any industry-specific regulations (e.g., medical or financial records). Use S3 Object Locking to enforce retention policies and prevent unauthorized deletions.
Data Retention: Implement lifecycle policies to automatically manage the retention of images and delete them after a specific period or once they are no longer required.
9. Automation and Integration
Lambda Functions: Integrate with AWS Lambda for serverless processing tasks, such as image optimization, format conversion, or metadata extraction when images are uploaded to S3.
S3 Events: Use S3 event notifications to trigger workflows like sending notifications or invoking a Lambda function whenever an image is uploaded or deleted.
AWS Step Functions: Use Step Functions to build workflows that automatically process images upon upload, such as generating thumbnails or applying image recognition.
Summary
When using AWS S3 to store i-scanned images, key points to focus on include secure access controls (IAM, MFA, bucket policies), efficient data management (lifecycle policies, versioning, and storage classes), performance optimization (multipart uploads, transfer acceleration), and security measures (encryption, monitoring, logging). These measures ensure that images are stored securely, are easily accessible when needed, and are managed cost-effectively, while adhering to compliance requirements and providing backup and disaster recovery capabilities.



--------------------------------
Privileged access is one of the most critical areas for securing your Spring Boot microservice that migrates and 
manages i-scanned images and metadata. Mismanagement or exploitation of privileged access can lead to severe data breaches, 
system compromise, and unauthorized operations. By applying the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), 
Privileged Account Management (PAM) solutions, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Separation of Duties (SoD), 
you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized privileged access. Regular access reviews, audits, and 
real-time monitoring will help detect and prevent any misuse of elevated privileges. 
These security controls ensure that only authorized individuals can perform critical actions,
keeping your system and data secure from misuse or attack.



To mitigate the risk of vulnerability exploitation in your Spring Boot service for migrating and managing i-scanned images, 
it is crucial to implement strong security controls across the development, deployment, and operations phases. 
Regular patching, secure coding practices, secure configurations, web application firewalls, vulnerability scanning,
penetration testing, and real-time monitoring will reduce the attack surface and limit the chances of an exploit succeeding. 
By securing the AWS S3 storage, Oracle database, and REST API endpoints, and maintaining strong access controls and monitoring, 
you can effectively reduce the likelihood of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in your application. Additionally, 
a well-defined recovery plan ensures that in case of exploitation, the system can quickly recover with minimal impact.





External attacks pose significant risks to your Spring Boot microservice that handles i-scanned image data, 
especially when interacting with AWS S3 and Oracle database. 
To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to implement strong authentication mechanisms, data encryption, input validation, and access controls. 
Additionally, using DDoS protection measures like AWS Shield, securing your S3 bucket and Oracle database, and setting up real-time monitoring can help detect 
and mitigate attacks. An incident response plan and backup strategies will ensure that you can respond quickly and recover from any external security incidents. 
By applying these controls, you can safeguard the application from common external attacks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of the image and metadata management system.






To mitigate the risk of Information Disclosure in your Spring Boot service for migrating and managing i-scanned images, it's crucial to implement strong controls around data encryption, access control, credentials management, logging, and data exposure. Encrypting data at rest and in transit, enforcing strict access policies, and using secure logging practices will protect sensitive image data and metadata from unauthorized exposure. Additionally, using versioning, backups, and access controls will help prevent accidental or malicious information disclosure. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations will further protect sensitive data and maintain privacy. These measures are essential for securing image and metadata management while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data.

To prevent repudiation in your image migration and management system, it's critical to implement a combination of secure logging, non-repudiation mechanisms, audit trails, and immutable storage. By capturing detailed logs, using cryptographic signatures, ensuring strong authentication, and enabling versioning and backups, you can ensure that any actions performed in the system are traceable, verifiable, and non-repudiable. These measures will not only enhance security but will also provide accountability and transparency, mitigating the risk of repudiation in case of malicious or unintended actions.

o protect the Spring Boot service against spoofing, strong authentication, authorization, and identity verification controls are essential. By using techniques such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure API access, IAM roles with least-privilege policies, and encrypted communications, you can ensure that only legitimate users and services interact with your AWS S3 resources. Regular monitoring, logging, and security audits are also key to detecting and preventing spoofing attempts. These controls should be implemented throughout the system to secure sensitive image data and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of resources.



This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and design of the Spring Boot Microservice that facilitates the migration of existing scanned images (i-scanned images) from an Oracle Database to AWS S3, as well as exposing a set of RESTful APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on images stored in AWS S3. The service is designed to handle large-scale image storage and retrieval, enabling efficient management of scanned image data with secure and scalable cloud storage.

Key Functionalities:
Image Migration to AWS S3:

This functionality involves migrating i-scanned images currently stored in an Oracle Database to AWS S3 for long-term storage and scalability. The service will read the image data from the Oracle table and upload it to S3, ensuring that the metadata (such as image ID, name, and other relevant information) is also updated accordingly in the database.
The migration process will be optimized for large volumes of data, and the images will be uploaded in a way that minimizes downtime and ensures data integrity.
CRUD Operations for Image Management:

Create: Upload new images to S3 via RESTful endpoints, with metadata (such as image details, file type, and creation date) being saved in the Oracle database.
Read: Retrieve images stored in AWS S3 based on metadata queries from the Oracle database, providing a seamless way to access and manage images.
Update: Allow modification of metadata and potentially replace or update images in S3 based on provided image identifiers.
Delete: Provide a mechanism to delete images from AWS S3 and remove associated metadata from the Oracle database when images are no longer required.
Architecture Overview:
The service will be developed using Spring Boot, utilizing the AWS SDK for S3 integration and JPA for database interaction. The architecture will include:

Oracle Database to store image metadata.
AWS S3 as the cloud storage service for scanned images.
Spring Boot Application that orchestrates image migration and provides a set of RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
Use Cases:
Image Migration:
As part of the initial setup, existing scanned images from the Oracle database will be transferred to AWS S3 to take advantage of scalable cloud storage.
Image CRUD Operations:
Allow administrators or applications to upload, retrieve, update, or delete images using simple REST API calls, while ensuring that all operations are logged and properly handled in both S3 and Oracle database.
Benefits:
Scalability: Storing images on AWS S3 provides scalable storage for both current and future image data, ensuring the system can handle increasing volumes of scanned images over time.
Efficiency: The migration process is designed to minimize downtime and ensure efficient upload and retrieval operations.
Security: Authentication and access control mechanisms (e.g., IAM roles, policies, or STS) will be implemented to secure both the image data stored in AWS and the metadata stored in Oracle.
Cost Efficiency: AWS S3 offers flexible storage classes, such as S3 Standard and S3 Infrequent Access, allowing for optimized costs based on usage patterns.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: For building the microservice and exposing RESTful APIs.
AWS S3: For storing scanned images securely and efficiently.
AWS SDK: For interacting with AWS S3 to upload, retrieve, and delete images.
Oracle Database: To store image metadata, enabling tracking and management of images.
JPA (Java Persistence API): For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the Oracle database.
CloudWatch Logs: For monitoring and logging the image upload process.
Expected Outcomes:
Successful migration of existing image data from Oracle Database to AWS S3.
A set of efficient and secure APIs for performing CRUD operations on images, allowing for smooth image management.
A cloud-based, highly available, and cost-effective solution for storing and managing large volumes of image data.
By using this service, businesses can centralize their image data on AWS, ensure better data availability, and leverage AWS's scalable and cost-effective infrastructure while maintaining control over metadata through the Oracle database.

This document provides further details on the design, architecture, and operational flow of the Spring Boot service for image migration and management.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To authenticate your on-premises application for AWS S3 access, you can use IAM Access Keys for simple use cases
ensuring that your credentials are stored securely and granting the least privilege required for your use case is critical.

Role Policies: Ensure that the IAM role has the appropriate policies attached for accessing S3.
Security: This approach avoids long-term access keys and is a more secure method, as credentials are ephemeral

Key Considerations:
Access Key Security: Store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key securely, either in environment variables or a secure credentials store.
Policy Scope: Only grant the minimum required permissions (e.g., s3:PutObject for upload access).
Rotation of Access Keys: Periodically rotate IAM user credentials for added security.




To authenticate and securely upload images to AWS S3 from your on-premises application, you need to set up authentication between your on-premises application and AWS S3. There are several ways to authenticate and securely upload files to S3. Below are the recommended methods:




However, since your application is on-premises (not hosted in AWS), you will need to use AWS IAM Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) as a secure way to authenticate.

Here’s how you can authenticate from your on-premises application using IAM Access Keys:

Steps:
Create an IAM User:

In the AWS Management Console, create an IAM user with permissions to interact with S3.
Go to IAM > Users > Add User.
Select Programmatic Access to allow API calls (for example, via the AWS SDK).
Attach the necessary policy, such as AmazonS3FullAccess or a custom policy with limited S3 access.

Image Migration (6 TB): Batch migration of existing image data from Oracle to AWS S3.
REST API for Upload (0.9 TB/year): Exposing secure RESTful APIs for image uploads, with metadata stored in Oracle.

ou will create a Spring Boot microservice with two core functionalities:

Image Migration: Migrate images stored in Oracle to AWS S3.
Image Upload & Metadata Storage: Provide RESTful APIs for uploading images to S3 and storing metadata in Oracle.

Use Case 1: Migrate Existing i-Scanned-Images from Oracle to AWS S3
Fetch Images from Oracle

Query Oracle for records where status = 'PENDING'.
Retrieve ISI Barcode, image BLOB, and metadata (file type, size, creation date, etc.).
Process and Prepare Image Data

Convert the BLOB to an appropriate image format (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Compress the image if isiFileCompressed = true.
Upload Image to AWS S3 via IBM API Connect

Call the IBM APIC API (acts as a gateway) to upload the image to S3.
S3 returns a file URL after a successful upload.
Update Oracle with Migration Status

Update the Oracle table with the S3 file URL and set status = 'COMPLETED'.
If the upload fails, set status = 'FAILED' and store the error message.
Scheduled Batch Execution

Implement a Spring Scheduler (@Scheduled) to periodically process pending images.

I will create an architecture diagram in Draw.io for your Spring Boot microservice that:

Picks images from Oracle and uploads them to AWS S3.
Accepts JSON payloads to perform CRUD operations on AWS S3 and Oracle.

Here is the architecture diagram illustrating the Spring Boot microservice for handling image uploads to AWS S3 while storing metadata in Oracle



















Currently, I am engaged with a high-priority task that requires my immediate attention. However, I would like to reassure you that I had already shared the impact assessment some time ago.

Once I complete my current activity, I will focus on preparing the detailed design. Please let me know if there are any immediate concerns or if you need any interim inputs in the meantime.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

To design an effective request and response structure for an application that updates an Oracle table and stores an associated document in AWS S3, you should consider the key operations and metadata involved in the process. Here's a recommended structure:

Request Structure
The application will receive a JSON payload containing the metadata for the Oracle table update and the file/document to be stored in S3 (as a Base64-encoded string or a pre-uploaded URL).

    "recordId": "12345",
    "updateFields": {
      "column1": "value1",
      "column2": "value2",
      "column3": "value3"
    }
  },
  "document": {
    "fileName": "example.pdf",
    "fileContent": "Base64EncodedFileStringHere", // Optional if using pre-uploaded URL
    "contentType": "application/pdf",
    "s3Bucket": "my-s3-bucket",
    "s3FolderPath": "documents/uploads"
  }
}
Request Parameters
tableData:

recordId: The primary key or unique identifier of the record in the Oracle table.
updateFields: A map of column names and their new values.
document:

Add security mechanisms (e.g., OAuth or API keys).
Publish the API:

Publish the API to a catalog in IBM API Connect.
5. Consume the API
API Call Example (Using Postman):

URL: https://your-apic-endpoint/images
Method: POST
Headers: Include any required authentication headers.
Body: Use form-data with a file key to upload the image.
Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "success",
    "s3Url": "https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image.jpg"
}


To migrate BLOB (image) data from an Oracle table to AWS S3, you need to define a clear order of processing. Here's a typical flow for such a task:

1. **Prepare Environment**
   - Ensure you have connectivity to both the Oracle database and AWS S3.
   - Install and configure required libraries/tools (e.g., Oracle JDBC driver, AWS SDK for S3, and a language runtime like Java or Python).

2. **Extract Data**
   - Query the Oracle table to fetch the BLOB data and any associated metadata required for S3 (like object keys or metadata tags).
   - Use streaming to handle large BLOBs efficiently.

3. **Transform Data (Optional)**
   - Convert the BLOB to a format suitable for storage in S3, if necessary.
   - Generate meaningful S3 object keys (e.g., using metadata or primary keys from the database).

4. **Upload to S3**
   - Use the AWS SDK (e.g., `boto3` for Python or AWS Java SDK) to upload the BLOB data to S3.
   - Include metadata from the database as S3 object metadata or tags.

5. **Update Oracle Table (Optional)**
   - Write back the S3 URL or the object key to the Oracle table for future reference.
   - Update a status column (e.g., `MIGRATION_STATUS`) to indicate successful upload.

### Example Code Workflow (Using Python and `boto3`)
```python
import boto3
import cx_Oracle

# S3 Configuration
s3_client = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='your-access-key', aws_secret_access_key='your-secret-key')
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'

# Oracle Configuration
connection = cx_Oracle.connect('user/password@hostname/service_name')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Query to Fetch Data
cursor.execute("SELECT ID, IMAGE_BLOB FROM YOUR_TABLE WHERE MIGRATION_STATUS = 'PENDING'")

for record in cursor:
    image_id, image_blob = record
    object_key = f"images/{image_id}.jpg"  # Construct S3 object key

    # Upload to S3
    try:
        s3_client.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key, Body=image_blob.read())
        print(f"Uploaded {object_key} to S3")

        # Update Database
        cursor.execute("UPDATE YOUR_TABLE SET S3_URL = :1, MIGRATION_STATUS = 'DONE' WHERE ID = :2",
                       (f"s3://{bucket_name}/{object_key}", image_id))
        connection.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to upload {image_id}: {e}")

# Close Resources
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

---

### Order of Processing
1. **Query Oracle for BLOBs**: Retrieve the rows to process (e.g., based on `MIGRATION_STATUS = 'PENDING'`).
2. **Process Each BLOB**: Fetch, upload to S3, and update the database in a loop.
3. **Handle Errors**: Log failures and reprocess if necessary.
4. **Update Oracle Table**: Mark the rows as migrated with the S3 URL or status.




The migration service involves transferring scanned images stored in Oracle tables (like i-scanned-image) to an S3 storage environment. The service will automate the extraction, transformation, and upload of images, while maintaining important metadata (such as descriptions) to ensure that the original information is preserved in the cloud. This migration service reduces the reliance on local databases and leverages scalable, cost-effective cloud storage (S3) for long-term image retention and retrieval.
