Currently, I am engaged with a high-priority task that requires my immediate attention. However, I would like to reassure you that I had already shared the impact assessment some time ago.

Once I complete my current activity, I will focus on preparing the detailed design. Please let me know if there are any immediate concerns or if you need any interim inputs in the meantime.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

To design an effective request and response structure for an application that updates an Oracle table and stores an associated document in AWS S3, you should consider the key operations and metadata involved in the process. Here's a recommended structure:

Request Structure
The application will receive a JSON payload containing the metadata for the Oracle table update and the file/document to be stored in S3 (as a Base64-encoded string or a pre-uploaded URL).

Example Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "tableData": {
    "recordId": "12345",
    "updateFields": {
      "column1": "value1",
      "column2": "value2",
      "column3": "value3"
    }
  },
  "document": {
    "fileName": "example.pdf",
    "fileContent": "Base64EncodedFileStringHere", // Optional if using pre-uploaded URL
    "contentType": "application/pdf",
    "s3Bucket": "my-s3-bucket",
    "s3FolderPath": "documents/uploads"
  }
}
Request Parameters
tableData:

recordId: The primary key or unique identifier of the record in the Oracle table.
updateFields: A map of column names and their new values.
document:

fileName: The name of the file to be stored in S3.
fileContent: The file's content in Base64 format (optional if using pre-uploaded URL).
contentType: The MIME type of the file (e.g., application/pdf).
s3Bucket: The target S3 bucket name.
s3FolderPath: The folder path in the S3 bucket.
Response Structure
The response should indicate whether the operation succeeded and provide details of the Oracle update and S3 upload.

Example Response (Success):

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Record updated and document uploaded successfully.",
  "oracleUpdate": {
    "recordId": "12345",
    "updatedFields": {
      "column1": "value1",
      "column2": "value2",
      "column3": "value3"
    }
  },
  "s3Upload": {
    "fileName": "example.pdf",
    "s3Url": "https://my-s3-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/uploads/example.pdf",
    "fileSize": 204800,
    "uploadTimestamp": "2025-01-02T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
Example Response (Failure):

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to update Oracle table or upload document.",
  "errorDetails": {
    "oracleUpdate": {
      "recordId": "12345",
      "error": "Primary key not found in the database."
    },
    "s3Upload": {
      "fileName": "example.pdf",
      "error": "Failed to upload document to S3 due to network timeout."
    }
  }
}
Response Parameters
status:

success or error.
message:

A human-readable explanation of the result.
oracleUpdate:

recordId: The record's unique identifier.
updatedFields: Details of the fields updated.
error: Error details if the Oracle update fails.
s3Upload:

fileName: The uploaded file's name.
s3Url: The S3 URL for accessing the uploaded file.
fileSize: The file's size in bytes.
uploadTimestamp: The timestamp of the upload.
error: Error details if the S3 upload fails.
Validation and Error Scenarios
Request Validation:

Ensure recordId, updateFields, and document are present.
Validate the Base64-encoded content if provided.
Error Handling:

Return specific error messages for:
Invalid recordId.
Failure to update Oracle table.
Failure to upload to S3.
Partial Success:

If one operation (Oracle update or S3 upload) succeeds, indicate partial success in the response.
Implementation Considerations
Asynchronous Processing:

Use asynchronous processing to handle large file uploads efficiently.
Provide a tracking ID for the operation's status.
Security:

Encrypt the file content in transit and at rest.
Use IAM roles for secure S3 access.
Logging and Monitoring:

Log all operations for troubleshooting and audits.



The ISIBARCODE module is designed to manage barcodes within the I-Prompt application, facilitating efficient tracking, validation, and retrieval of items such as documents, inventory, or certifications. It integrates seamlessly with the application's workflows to streamline operations for Close Brothers.

When uploading a document to AWS S3, the response returned to the calling application should provide essential information about the success of the operation and details of the uploaded file. Here's a recommended structure:

To migrate BLOB (image) data from an Oracle table to AWS S3, you need to define a clear order of processing. Here's a typical flow for such a task:

1. **Prepare Environment**
   - Ensure you have connectivity to both the Oracle database and AWS S3.
   - Install and configure required libraries/tools (e.g., Oracle JDBC driver, AWS SDK for S3, and a language runtime like Java or Python).

2. **Extract Data**
   - Query the Oracle table to fetch the BLOB data and any associated metadata required for S3 (like object keys or metadata tags).
   - Use streaming to handle large BLOBs efficiently.

3. **Transform Data (Optional)**
   - Convert the BLOB to a format suitable for storage in S3, if necessary.
   - Generate meaningful S3 object keys (e.g., using metadata or primary keys from the database).

4. **Upload to S3**
   - Use the AWS SDK (e.g., `boto3` for Python or AWS Java SDK) to upload the BLOB data to S3.
   - Include metadata from the database as S3 object metadata or tags.

5. **Update Oracle Table (Optional)**
   - Write back the S3 URL or the object key to the Oracle table for future reference.
   - Update a status column (e.g., `MIGRATION_STATUS`) to indicate successful upload.

---

### Example Code Workflow (Using Python and `boto3`)
```python
import boto3
import cx_Oracle

# S3 Configuration
s3_client = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='your-access-key', aws_secret_access_key='your-secret-key')
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'

# Oracle Configuration
connection = cx_Oracle.connect('user/password@hostname/service_name')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Query to Fetch Data
cursor.execute("SELECT ID, IMAGE_BLOB FROM YOUR_TABLE WHERE MIGRATION_STATUS = 'PENDING'")

for record in cursor:
    image_id, image_blob = record
    object_key = f"images/{image_id}.jpg"  # Construct S3 object key

    # Upload to S3
    try:
        s3_client.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key, Body=image_blob.read())
        print(f"Uploaded {object_key} to S3")

        # Update Database
        cursor.execute("UPDATE YOUR_TABLE SET S3_URL = :1, MIGRATION_STATUS = 'DONE' WHERE ID = :2",
                       (f"s3://{bucket_name}/{object_key}", image_id))
        connection.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to upload {image_id}: {e}")

# Close Resources
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

---

### Order of Processing
1. **Query Oracle for BLOBs**: Retrieve the rows to process (e.g., based on `MIGRATION_STATUS = 'PENDING'`).
2. **Process Each BLOB**: Fetch, upload to S3, and update the database in a loop.
3. **Handle Errors**: Log failures and reprocess if necessary.
4. **Update Oracle Table**: Mark the rows as migrated with the S3 URL or status.




The migration service involves transferring scanned images stored in Oracle tables (like i-scanned-image) to an S3 storage environment. The service will automate the extraction, transformation, and upload of images, while maintaining important metadata (such as descriptions) to ensure that the original information is preserved in the cloud. This migration service reduces the reliance on local databases and leverages scalable, cost-effective cloud storage (S3) for long-term image retention and retrieval.
