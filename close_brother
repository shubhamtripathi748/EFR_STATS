### Design Document: Handling AWS S3 Downtime and Connectivity Loss

---

#### **Overview**
This document outlines the handling strategy for two critical failure scenarios in a system integrated with AWS S3:
1. **AWS S3 Downtime**: When the S3 service is unavailable due to regional outages or internal failures.
2. **AWS Connectivity Loss**: When the application cannot connect to AWS services due to network issues, misconfigurations, or local server failures.

---

### **1. AWS S3 Downtime**

#### **Potential Issues**
- **Read Failures**: Unable to fetch data from S3 buckets.
- **Write Failures**: Unable to upload objects to S3.
- **Delete Failures**: Unable to delete objects from S3.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Retry Mechanism**:
  - Implement exponential backoff with a maximum retry limit for all S3 operations.
  - Example: Retry after 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, etc., up to a maximum of 5 retries.
  
- **Fallback Storage**:
  - Use a backup storage mechanism such as local storage or a relational database to temporarily hold data until S3 becomes available.
  - Example: Save images or files in a local folder or database with a status flag indicating pending S3 upload.

- **Alerting and Monitoring**:
  - Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms to detect S3 outages and notify the operations team.
  - Use application logs and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track errors.

- **Data Recovery**:
  - For write failures, queue failed operations in a persistent storage (e.g., a database or message queue like Kafka) and retry once S3 is back online.
  - For read failures, serve pre-fetched or cached data to users.

### **2. AWS Connectivity Loss**

#### **Potential Issues**
- **All AWS Services Impacted**: This includes not just S3 but also other services like IAM, CloudWatch, etc.
- **Inconsistent Application Behavior**: If critical operations depend on S3, the entire system could fail.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Health Checks**:
  - Periodically check the connectivity to AWS endpoints using ping or status APIs.
  - Detect connectivity issues early and log errors for visibility.

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
  - Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent continuous retries when connectivity is lost.
  - Example: After several failed attempts, the circuit breaker opens, halting further requests temporarily.

- **Offline Queueing**:
  - Queue all operations requiring AWS connectivity in a persistent storage layer.
  - Example: Use a database or local file system to hold operations and process them once connectivity is restored.

- **Redundant Connectivity**:
  - Use multiple network routes or services like AWS Direct Connect and VPN to ensure redundancy.
  - Example: Switch between primary and backup internet connections when issues are detected.

- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Offer limited functionality during connectivity issues.
  - Example: Allow users to perform non-S3-dependent tasks while queuing or deferring S3 operations.

### **Behavior Flow During Failures**

#### **Case: S3 Downtime**
1. Attempt S3 operation (upload, read, or delete).
2. If S3 is unavailable:
   - Retry the operation.
   - If retries fail:
     - Queue the operation for later processing.
     - Log the failure and send an alert.
     - Optionally store data in fallback storage.

3. Process queued operations once S3 is back online.

#### **Case: AWS Connectivity Loss**
1. Detect connectivity issues using health checks or monitoring tools.
2. Halt S3 operations temporarily (circuit breaker).
3. Queue all S3-related tasks in persistent storage.
4. Notify the operations team of the connectivity issue.
5. Resume normal operations when connectivity is restored.

### **Implementation Example**

#### **Retry Logic**
```java
int maxRetries = 5;
int retryCount = 0;
while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
        // Perform S3 operation
        s3Client.putObject(bucketName, key, file);
        break;
    } catch (SdkClientException e) {
        retryCount++;
        Thread.sleep((int) Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
    }
}
if (retryCount == maxRetries) {
    log.error("Failed to upload to S3 after multiple retries");
    queueOperationForRetry(bucketName, key, file);
}
```

#### **Circuit Breaker Example**
Use libraries like Resilience4j to implement circuit breaker patterns:
```java
CircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
    .failureRateThreshold(50)
    .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .build();
CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker.of("s3Service", config);

Supplier<Response> decoratedCall = CircuitBreaker.decorateSupplier(circuitBreaker, () -> s3Service.uploadFile(file));
```

### **Summary of Recommendations**

| Failure Scenario       | Mitigation Strategy                             | Tools/Technologies                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Downtime**        | Retry mechanism, fallback storage, alerts      | Spring Retry, AWS SDK, CloudWatch              |
| **Connectivity Loss**  | Circuit breaker, offline queueing, redundancy  | Resilience4j, Kafka, AWS Direct Connect/VPN    |

By implementing these strategies, the system can handle S3 downtime or connectivity issues gracefully, ensuring data integrity and minimal disruption to users.
